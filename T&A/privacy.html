<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last updated: January 2025</p>

<p>
ExpenseFlow is a personal finance tracking application. It is a non-commercial personal project and is provided “as is.”
This Privacy Policy explains how data is collected, processed, and stored in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
</p>

<h2>1. Data Controller</h2>
<p>
For GDPR purposes, the data controller is the individual developer who built ExpenseFlow.<br>
If you require clarification or deletion of your data, you may contact the developer using the GitHub profile associated with this project.
</p>

<h2>2. What Data Is Collected</h2>

<h3>2.1. If you sign in with Google</h3>

  <li>Your <strong>Google User ID (UID)</strong> – obtained from the Google Identity token ("sub" field)</li>
  <li>Your financial data entered into the application (expenses, categories, notes, utilities, car expenses, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>
No email address, profile picture, name, or additional personal data is collected.
</p>

<h3>2.2. Visitor Mode</h3>
<p>
In visitor mode, no personal data is sent to any server. All information is stored locally in your browser using <strong>localStorage</strong> and is deleted when your browser data is cleared.
</p>

<h2>3. Purpose of Data Processing</h2>
<p>Data is processed exclusively for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Allowing you to log in and access your individual financial entries</li>
  <li>Saving your expense data so it is accessible across sessions</li>
  <li>Providing app functionality (charts, summaries, monthly reports)</li>
</ul>
<p>No profiling, marketing, or automated decision-making takes place.</p>

<h2>4. Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR Article 6)</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Art. 6(1)(b)</strong> – Processing is necessary for providing the service (saving and retrieving your personal finance data)</li>
  <li><strong>Art. 6(1)(a)</strong> – Your consent when you choose to sign in with Google</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Where and How Data Is Stored</h2>
<p>
If you sign in with Google, data is stored in <strong>Firebase Firestore (Google Cloud)</strong>, under your unique Google UID.  
Storage is handled by Google’s secure infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
In visitor mode, data is stored only locally in your browser.
</p>

<h2>6. Cookies</h2>
<p>
ExpenseFlow does not set any cookies of its own.  
However, Google Identity Services may set <strong>authentication cookies</strong> necessary for:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Login and session management</li>
  <li>Security and fraud prevention</li>
</ul>
<p>
No analytics, tracking, or advertising cookies are used by ExpenseFlow.
</p>

<h2>7. Your GDPR Rights</h2>
<p>You have the following rights:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Right of access</strong> – You may request details of your stored data</li>
  <li><strong>Right to rectification</strong> – You may correct inaccurate data</li>
  <li><strong>Right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”)</strong> – You may request data deletion</li>
  <li><strong>Right to restriction of processing</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Right to data portability</strong> (export your data)</li>
  <li><strong>Right to withdraw consent</strong> – by deleting your Firebase account data</li>
</ul>

<p>
Firebase does not allow direct remote deletion by users, so you may contact the developer to request data removal.
</p>

<h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Data stored in Firebase is kept until you request deletion.</li>
  <li>Data in visitor mode exists only locally and is deleted by your browser.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Google Identity Services</strong> – for authentication</li>
  <li><strong>Firebase / Google Cloud</strong> – for secure data storage</li>
</ul>

<p>No other third-party services are used.</p>
